FTP/proftpd does not have a standardized request format like RTSP or HTTP. However, common FTP client requests typically include commands like USER, PASS, LIST, RETR, STOR, etc. Each of these commands serves a specific function in the FTP protocol. Here are some examples of FTP client requests:

1. USER: ["USER <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
2. PASS: ["PASS <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
3. LIST: ["LIST <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
4. RETR: ["RETR <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
5. STOR: ["STOR <<VALUE>>\r\n"]

These are just a few examples, and there are many other FTP commands that can be used in client requests depending on the specific actions you want to perform on the FTP server.
Here are some additional examples of FTP client request templates for the proftpd protocol:

1. CWD (Change Working Directory): ["CWD <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
2. MKD (Make Directory): ["MKD <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
3. RMD (Remove Directory): ["RMD <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
4. DELE (Delete File): ["DELE <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
5. RNFR (Rename From): ["RNFR <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
6. RNTO (Rename To): ["RNTO <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
7. TYPE (Set Transfer Type): ["TYPE <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
8. PASV (Passive Mode): ["PASV\r\n"]
9. PORT (Active Mode): ["PORT <<VALUE>>\r\n"]
10. ABOR (Abort Transfer): ["ABOR\r\n"]

These are just a few more examples of FTP client request templates that can be used with the proftpd protocol to perform various operations on an FTP server. Each command serves a specific purpose in managing file transfers and interactions with the server.
